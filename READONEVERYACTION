CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE - READ BEFORE EVERY ACTION

==========================================
MONGODB INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS
==========================================

NEVER FALL BACK TO POSTGRESQL FOR NOTE STORAGE

The system MUST fail visibly when MongoDB is unavailable.
No fallback mechanisms are allowed.
No silent degradation to PostgreSQL storage.

When MongoDB connection fails:
- Show clear error messages
- Display connection status
- Fail fast and loud
- Do NOT attempt PostgreSQL fallback

This ensures:
- Data integrity maintained
- Infrastructure issues are visible
- No silent data loss or corruption
- Clear system health monitoring

VIOLATION OF THIS RULE IS UNACCEPTABLE

USER REQUIREMENT: VISIBLE FAILURES ONLY
