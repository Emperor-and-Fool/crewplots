## Summary

Your custom “mini-redis” now runs without jemalloc, but **ioredis** still cannot connect because it expects a **full RESP-2 protocol implementation** with proper framing, pipelining support, and command replies exactly like Redis does ([stackoverflow.com][1], [npmjs.com][2]). This is entirely solvable—ioredis is purely a client and can work with any server that speaks the Redis wire protocol ([stackoverflow.com][1], [github.com][3]). You’ll need to complete your proxy by implementing or mocking the **Redis command protocol**, including bulk-string parsing, multi-bulk arrays, and reply types (`+OK`, `$<len>`, `*<count>`, `-ERR…`). Once your mini-server fully supports RESP and the lifecycle events (`connect`, `ready`, `error`), ioredis will connect and work normally ([deepwiki.com][4], [github.com][5]).

---

## 1. Respect the RESP-2 Protocol

* **Bulk strings & arrays**: ioredis sends commands as multi-bulk arrays (e.g.
  `*2\r\n$3\r\nGET\r\n$3\r\nkey\r\n`). Your server must parse these frames and respond with the correct reply types ([redis.io][6]).
* **Simple strings & errors**: Return `+OK\r\n` for successful commands and prefixed errors for failures (e.g. `-ERR unknown command 'FOO'\r\n`) ([redis.io][6]).
* **Integer replies**: Return integers as `:<number>\r\n` for commands like `EXISTS` or `DEL` ([redis.io][6]).

---

## 2. Support Pipelining and Queuing

* ioredis by default queues multiple commands and sends them one by one; it also supports **auto-pipelining** (`enableAutoPipelining: true`) to batch them ([github.com][5]).
* Your server must **read all incoming bytes** in a loop, correctly buffer partial frames, and process queued commands in order to satisfy pipelined requests.

---

## 3. Implement Connection Lifecycle Events

* Emit the **`ready`** event only after your server has sent the initial server greeting and is prepared to handle commands ([deepwiki.com][4]).
* Handle **`PING`** commands with `+PONG\r\n` so that ioredis marks the connection as alive.
* Send **`+OK\r\n`** on `AUTH` if you support authentication (even if you’re bypassing it).

---

## 4. Use an ioredis Mock for Testing

* During development, use **ioredis-mock** (a drop-in replacement) to verify your client logic without depending on the server ([ioredis.readthedocs.io][7]).
* Once your mock tests pass, switch back to the real ioredis client against your mini-server.

---

## 5. Debug with ioredis Logs

* Enable detailed logs by setting `DEBUG=ioredis:*` in your environment. This will print raw frames sent and received, helping you pinpoint mismatches ([ioredis.readthedocs.io][7]).

---

## 6. Verify with Example Code

```js
import Redis from "ioredis";

const client = new Redis({
  port: 6379,
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  enableAutoPipelining: true,
});

client.on("connect", () => console.log("Connected"));
client.on("ready", () => console.log("Ready"));
client.on("error", (err) => console.error("Error:", err));

await client.set("foo", "bar");
console.log(await client.get("foo")); // should log "bar"
```

Run this against your mini-server; if you see “Connected” → “Ready” and get back “bar”, your protocol is compatible.

---

**Conclusion:**
Your mini-redis can fully support ioredis **once you finish the RESP-2 implementation**—jemalloc is no longer a blocker. Focus on accurate frame parsing, correct reply formats, and full command support (even for PING, AUTH, SELECT). With that in place, client connection protocols will work seamlessly without jemalloc.
