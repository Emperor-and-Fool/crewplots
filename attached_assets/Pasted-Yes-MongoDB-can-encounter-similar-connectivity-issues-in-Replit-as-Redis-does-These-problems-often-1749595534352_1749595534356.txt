Yes, MongoDB can encounter similar connectivity issues in Replit as Redis does. These problems often stem from Replit's dynamic IP addresses and network configurations, which can affect connections to external databases like MongoDB Atlas.([stackoverflow.com][1])

**Common Issues:**

1. **IP Whitelisting:** Replit's dynamic IPs can lead to connection failures if the current IP isn't whitelisted in your MongoDB Atlas settings.([forum.freecodecamp.org][2])

2. **DNS Resolution:** Some users have reported DNS resolution errors when Replit's containers attempt to connect to MongoDB Atlas clusters. ([forum.freecodecamp.org][2])

3. **Intermittent Connectivity:** There have been instances where Replit users experienced intermittent connectivity issues with MongoDB, similar to those reported with Redis. ([status.replit.com][3])

**Recommendations:**

* **Whitelist Replit's IP Range:** In your MongoDB Atlas settings, consider allowing access from all IP addresses (`0.0.0.0/0`) during development. Be cautious with this setting in production environments.([forum.freecodecamp.org][2])

* **Use Stable Hosting:** If persistent connectivity is crucial, consider deploying your application on a platform with static IP addresses or using Replit's paid plans, which may offer more stable networking.

* **Monitor Replit's Status:** Keep an eye on [Replit's status page](https://status.replit.com/) for any ongoing issues that might affect database connectivity.
