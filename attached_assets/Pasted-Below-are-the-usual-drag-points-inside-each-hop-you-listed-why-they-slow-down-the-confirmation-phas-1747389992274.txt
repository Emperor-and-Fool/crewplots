Below are the usual drag points inside each hop you listed, why they slow down the confirmation phase, and how to tell which one is stealing the milliseconds.
Step	Normal cost	What makes it swell	Quick measurement / fix
1 · Cookie parse in Express	1-3 ms	Nothing, unless you’ve added heavy middleware before cookie-parser (e.g., body-parser running on every GET)	Put cookieParser + session() at the very top; remove body-parsing for non-body routes.
2 · Session read from PostgreSQL	2-15 ms on same host	• Network: PG on a different VM/region (20-80 ms RTT)
• Connection churn: pool size too small → frequent TCP/TLS handshakes
• Big session blob: serialising 20-100 kB JSON for every click	• EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE sid = … – should be <1 ms.
• Pool: max: 10–20, keep-alive 30 s.
• Store only userId + tiny metadata; push big stuff into Redis or memory cache.
3 · deserializeUser / role check	2-20 ms with index	• Missing PK/unique index on users.id → seq scan
• Multiple queries (one for user, one for role, one for applicant)
• Cold DB cache	• EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1 – must hit users_pkey and finish in <2 ms.
• JOIN or batch fetch roles in the same query.
• Memoise: req.session.user = fullUser after first fetch.
4 · Extra round-trips from the client	0 extra calls	• Separate fetches for /auth/me, /roles, /profile fired back-to-back
• Each carries the same session lookup → multiplies latency	Collapse into one /auth/bootstrap that returns {user, roles, applicants}.
Concrete red flags in a PostgreSQL-backed session store

    Row size PG serialises the entire req.session object into a bytea column.
    If you’re stuffing the full user profile in there you pay JSON-stringify + PG I/O on every request.
    Fix: store only userId + timestamps; cache extras in Redis or on the Node heap.

    VACUUM lag The session table churns fast; if autovacuum can’t keep up, simple SELECT calls bloat to 50-100 ms.
    Fix: table‐level autovacuum settings (autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.01) or run DELETE FROM sessions WHERE expire < NOW() every few minutes.

    Connection pool thrash If you accept bursts of concurrent fetches (three React queries fire at once) but the PG pool only has 5 clients, two of them wait on a socket.
    Fix: bump pool size (10-20) or pre-fetch all data in a single request so React doesn’t fan out.

How to identify the worst offender in < 5 minutes

// middleware at the very top
app.use((req, _, next) => { req._t = Date.now(); next(); });

// after session & passport
app.use((req, _, next) => {
  const t = Date.now() - req._t;
  if (t > 25) console.warn('⚠️ auth pipeline slow:', t+'ms', req.path);
  next();
});

    If you see >25 ms for static routes like /me, the bottleneck is step 2 or step 3.
    Turn on PG’s log_min_duration_statement = 10 and read the server log — slow rows jump out.

Fast wins

    Keep PG local to the Node container (or use Redis for sessions).

    Index anything you hit in deserializeUser.

    Return all bootstrap data in one call and set isAuthenticated, authInitialized, user right there.

    Strip fat out of the session object; memoise the hydrated user record inside the session to avoid repeat queries during its lifetime.

    Set rolling:false in express-session so you don’t write the session row on every GET.

Do those and the auth gate should drop under ~30 ms — short enough that React won’t visibly race its own state updates.
