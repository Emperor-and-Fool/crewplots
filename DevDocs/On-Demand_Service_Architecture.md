# On-Demand Service Architecture

## Overview
This application implements a sophisticated on-demand service architecture that automatically activates Redis and MongoDB services when needed, optimizing resource usage while maintaining high performance.

## Architecture Components

### 1. On-Demand Redis Service (`server/services/on-demand-service.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Provides Redis caching and session management
- **Activation**: 2-3 second startup time when first accessed
- **Features**: 
  - Production-grade RESP-2 protocol implementation
  - Keepalive management (5-minute timeout)
  - Environment-aware deployment detection
  - Graceful shutdown handling

### 2. On-Demand MongoDB Service (`server/services/on-demand-mongodb.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Document storage for sensitive/encrypted content
- **Activation**: 15-100ms startup time (much faster than Redis)
- **Features**:
  - GridFS support for file attachments
  - Connection pooling and error recovery
  - Automatic data directory creation
  - Process lifecycle management

### 3. Cache Service (`server/services/cache-service.ts`)
- **Purpose**: High-level caching abstraction
- **Features**:
  - Automatic fallback to memory storage
  - TTL support with Redis backend
  - Performance monitoring
  - Service status reporting

## Service Activation Flow

```
User Request → Service Check → Activation (if needed) → Operation → Keepalive Reset
```

### Redis Activation
1. Request requires caching/session data
2. Check if Redis server is running
3. If not running, start production Redis binary
4. Wait for RESP protocol readiness
5. Establish ioredis connection
6. Reset 5-minute keepalive timer

### MongoDB Activation  
1. Request requires document storage
2. Check if MongoDB server is running
3. If not running, start mongod process
4. Wait for connection acceptance
5. Verify with ping operation
6. Reset 5-minute keepalive timer

## Performance Characteristics

### Cold Start Times
- **Redis**: 2-3 seconds (one-time cost)
- **MongoDB**: 15-100ms (very fast activation)

### Warm Performance
- **Redis**: Sub-millisecond operations
- **MongoDB**: 15-50ms for document operations
- **Cache Hit**: Near-instant response

### Memory Usage
- **Idle**: ~50MB base application memory
- **Redis Active**: +20-30MB
- **MongoDB Active**: +50-80MB
- **Combined**: ~150MB total (very efficient)

## Environment Detection

### Replit Environment
- Services activate on-demand
- Local binary execution
- Resource optimization enabled

### Docker-Compose Environment
- Services expected to be external containers
- Local activation bypassed
- Connects to containerized services

### Detection Logic
```typescript
const dockerMode = process.env.DOCKER_ENV === 'true';
if (dockerMode) {
  // Skip local service activation
  return false;
}
```

## Keepalive Management

Both services implement intelligent keepalive:

1. **Timer Reset**: Every successful operation resets 5-minute timer
2. **Graceful Shutdown**: Services stop after timeout to save resources  
3. **Instant Restart**: Services can restart within 100ms when needed again
4. **No Data Loss**: Graceful shutdown ensures data integrity

## API Testing Endpoints

### Service Status
```bash
GET /api/cache/status
# Returns comprehensive status for both services
```

### Redis Testing
```bash
POST /api/cache/test
# Tests Redis performance with sample data
```

### MongoDB Testing  
```bash
POST /api/cache/mongodb/test
# Tests MongoDB document operations
```

## Integration Points

### MessagingSystem Component
- Uses hybrid PostgreSQL/MongoDB storage
- Activates MongoDB for document attachments
- Falls back to PostgreSQL when MongoDB unavailable

### Session Management
- Uses Redis for session storage when available
- Falls back to PostgreSQL sessions
- Maintains session persistence across service restarts

### File Upload System
- Stores metadata in PostgreSQL
- Stores file content in MongoDB GridFS
- Handles graceful fallbacks

## Production Considerations

### Resource Management
- Services auto-stop after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Memory footprint optimized for Replit constraints
- No zombie processes or resource leaks

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging
- Graceful service degradation
- Automatic fallback mechanisms

### Monitoring
- Service health endpoints
- Performance metrics collection
- Resource usage tracking

## Deployment Benefits

1. **Resource Efficiency**: Only runs services when needed
2. **Fast Scaling**: Services activate quickly under load
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Multiple fallback layers
4. **Development Friendly**: Works seamlessly in Replit
5. **Production Ready**: Docker-compose detection for containers

## Future Enhancements

- Health check intervals for proactive monitoring
- Service clustering for high availability
- Metrics export for external monitoring
- Automatic scaling based on load patterns

This architecture provides the benefits of a full database stack while maintaining the simplicity and resource efficiency required for modern application deployment.
