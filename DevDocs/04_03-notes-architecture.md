# Notes System Architecture

## Core Principle
The notes functionality is a **self-contained module** within the messaging system, designed for maximum flexibility and minimal external impact.

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Scope Definition
- **Focus**: Notes functionality (not conversations/chat)
- **Boundary**: All note logic contained within messaging-system code
- **Interface**: Clean API handles for external components

### 2. Isolation Principle
- **Internal complexity**: Workflow logic, role permissions, categorization
- **External simplicity**: Simple method calls like `getNotes(userId, workflow)`
- **Zero coupling**: Other components unaware of internal note mechanics

### 3. Extension Strategy
- **New functionality**: Add features within messaging module only
- **Resource impact**: Minimal - no changes required in external code
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing interfaces remain stable

## API Design Pattern

### External Interface (Simple)
```javascript
// What other components see
const notes = await noteSystem.getNotes(userId, 'application');
const hasNotes = await noteSystem.hasNotes(userId, 'application');
await noteSystem.createNote(content, workflow, visibleToRoles);
```

### Internal Implementation (Complex)
```javascript
// What messaging system handles internally
- Workflow validation
- Role-based filtering  
- Permission checks
- Database queries
- Category management
```

## Workflow Integration

### Supported Workflows
- `application` - Job application process (automatically assigned to applicant portal messages)
- `crew` - Staff management  
- `location` - Site-specific notes
- `scheduling` - Shift and availability
- `knowledge` - Training and procedures
- `statistics` - Performance metrics

### Automatic Workflow Assignment
Messages created through specific interfaces are automatically tagged with appropriate workflows:
- **Applicant Portal**: All messages tagged with `application` workflow
- **Staff Dashboard**: Messages tagged with `crew` workflow
- **Location Management**: Messages tagged with `location` workflow

This ensures proper data categorization and role-based access control without requiring manual workflow selection.

### Role-Based Visibility
Each note specifies which roles can view it:
- Direct role specification in note metadata
- Runtime permission checking
- Flexible per-note access control

## Benefits

### For Development
- **Modular changes**: Extend notes without touching other code
- **Independent testing**: Test note features in isolation
- **Clear boundaries**: Easy to understand what belongs where

### For Performance
- **Minimal overhead**: New features don't impact existing functionality
- **Efficient queries**: Role filtering happens at database level
- **Resource isolation**: Note processing doesn't affect other systems

### For Maintenance
- **Predictable changes**: All note modifications happen in one place
- **Safe extensions**: Adding features won't break existing functionality
- **Clear debugging**: Issues isolated to messaging module

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Keep interfaces simple**: External components should use minimal, clear method calls
2. **Hide complexity**: All workflow, permission, and categorization logic stays internal
3. **Maintain boundaries**: Don't leak messaging concepts into other modules
4. **Design for extension**: New workflows and roles should be easy to add
5. **Preserve performance**: New features shouldn't impact existing operations

This architecture ensures the notes system can evolve sophisticated functionality while maintaining simplicity for consumers and zero impact on system resources.
